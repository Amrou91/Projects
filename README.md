## Project 1 : Balancing the load using HAProxy and transferring traffic to two microservices

- In this project, we will learn how to balance the traffic load to more than microservices based on a simple Round-Robin.

Example:

Hit 1  → Forward to the 1st microservice 
Hit 2 →  Forward to the 2nd microservice
